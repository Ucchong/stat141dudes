## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
list.files()
data = read.csv("heart_disease_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv")
# colnames = HeartDiseaseorAttack, HighBP, HighChol, CholCheck, BMI, Smoker, Stroke, Diabetes, PhysActivity, Fruit, Veggies, HvyAlcoholConsump, AnyHealthcare, NoDocbcCost, GenHlth, MentHlth, PhysHlth, DiffWalk
rows = c(1,2,3,6,7,8,9)
data = data[,rows]
#interested in col: HeartDiseaseorAttack, HighBP, HighChol, BMI, Smoker, Stroke, Diabetes, PhysActivity (first 8 col)
head(data)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
